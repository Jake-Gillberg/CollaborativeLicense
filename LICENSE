Collaborating on this Project: Any collaboration on this project (Compensated Cooperative License) is done with the assumption of NO COMPENSATION. I hope to find funding for the project of defining the license and related 
smart contracts which support the business model and to use the license itself as the model for the project which defines the license. That is, that users of the license would pay a licensing 
fee which would provide a revenue stream to compensate contributors and investors of the license itself. However, no funding has been secured. So, if you collaborate on the project by filing issues in 
GitHub, discussing the project, or any other form of collaboration you should assume that your collaboration is done free of charge without any expectation of compensation, now or in the future.
