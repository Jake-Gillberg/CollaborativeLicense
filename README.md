# Collaborative License
A license for compensated creative work.

The collaborative license is part of a larger vision for a revenue sharing business model intended for use on consensus based compute platforms such as RChain or Ethereum.

Projects which use the collaborative license:
* Identify a stream of revenue,
* Accept a liability along with collaborative work to be paid from the revenue stream,
* May accept investment in the form of loans with both principal and interest to be paid from the revenue stream,
* Relinquish any copyrights for work which has been compensated,
* Openly share any source materials for public collaboration and encourage derivative projects which accept the terms of the license, and
* Specify a form of governance to be used when making decisions concerning stakeholders of the project which clearly defines their rights and obligations.
