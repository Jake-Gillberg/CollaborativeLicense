# Collaborative License
A license for compensated creative work.

The collaborative license is part of a larger vision for a revenue sharing business model intended for use on consensus based compute platforms such as RChain or Ethereum.

Projects which use the collaborative license:
* Identify a stream of revenue,
* Accept a liability along with collaborative work to be paid from the revenue stream,
* May accept investment in the form of loans with both principal and interest to be paid from the revenue stream,
* Relinquish any copyrights for work which has been compensated,
* Openly share any source materials for public collaboration and encourage derivative projects which accept the terms of the license, and
* Specify a form of governance to be used when making decisions concerning stakeholders of the project which clearly defines their rights and obligations.

# Cooperative Decentralized Organizations
Before mass and digital communications, it was natural to consider an organization as residing at a physical place like a farm, a shop, or a factory. People gathered there to work together to make a product or service to be offered at the market. Because of the organization's physical presence the social conventions of physical property ownership were projected onto the organization. Those who owned the property rights to the land that was farmed, or the plot where the shop or factory sat, it was assumed, should not only command the operation of the work but should also determine how the proceeds be divided. We see this today in the nearly universal practice of owners setting a fixed price for labor in terms of an annual salary or hourly wage, with the remainder of the revenue, minus non-labor expenses, taken as profit.

Today, organizations exist which are mostly virtual, not tied to any physical location and operate globally. What binds them together is a shared governance, an agreement to work together to produce something of value and to share the proceeds. An increasing number of these organizations are constructed primarily out of software, and these software defined, virtual companies provide an increasing number of services which are replacing their physically rooted counterparts. There are, for example, online marketplaces for short-term lodging which compete effectively with traditional hotels, or marketplaces for on-demand transportation replacing city taxi services.

As the value in organizations is captured within the combination of software code and the network of people who use it, it's natural to question if the projection of physical property rights is still a fitting metaphor. It becomes even more questionable when considering the new, decentralized compute platforms which are emerging. Consensus based compute platforms like Ethereum and RChain, running on a globally distributed network of compute nodes, provide a secure, public compute utility where not only is the computer hardware not owned, leased, or rented as they would be under traditional organizational structures but the code, component by component, can earn its own keep, if you will, by charging for its own execution.

These consensus based compute platforms, due to the very high level of trust they establish, have changed the language that software developers use to describe their work, from the term "program" to "contract". These systems are in their very early stages of adoption but are already transacting $$ of value in simple value trade contracts. Innovative platforms using more expressive contracting languages, such as Rholang on the RChain platform, will enable the creation of organizations defined with an increasingly sophisticated, interdependent collection of computable contractual agreements. The scope of these contracts will quickly expand beyond simple financial transactions to include formally coded procedures for human processes like adding new workers, compensation, planning, etc. If you change the code, you'll change the organization.
